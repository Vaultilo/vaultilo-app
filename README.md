# Vaultilo

Vaultilo is a secure password manager based on blockstack authentication that not only stores passwords but also the credentials for crypto-wallets & nodes along with their SeedPhrase, Keystore file and Private keys. 

## Blockstack Authentication
The app uses Blockstack authentication for login.<br>
You can learn more about it[ here](https://docs.blockstack.org/develop/overview_auth.html).

## GAIA Hub
The app uses Gaia hub to store the user application data.Gaia hub is a decentralized storage provided by Blockstack.<br>
You can know more about it [here.](https://docs.blockstack.org/storage/overview.html)

### Deployment
Visit [here](www.vaultilo.com) to use the app<br>
You can also use chrome extension for your convenience.[This](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vaultilo/odiidinnhhckclnbldbimcndcifeenag) is the link for the extension.

## Running the app to local environment 

First run:

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!



### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
